# **App Name**: Naval Standoff

## Core Features:

- Ship Placement Grid: A grid that allows the user to place their ships for the game.
- Tracking grid: A game grid on which the computer records its' attempted hits
- Smart opponent: An AI tool to select and aim at coordinates on the game grid, and that can decide if it needs to act more randomly, or use some information to attempt to target a ship in a more intelligent manner.
- Fire button: A button which triggers the AI to shoot a missile.
- Game grid: Visual display to see where your ships are, and the status of hits (or misses)

## Style Guidelines:

- A general color scheme of blues, grays and white, suggestive of ocean combat.
- A highlight color such as orange or red, to suggest when hits have taken place.
- Use green to represent safe locations
- Use a clear font such as Helvetica Neue or Arial, but that simulates a technical readout.
- Use a missile icon to show where the missile was fired.
- Divide the layout into a game board view, and another area for the opponent to play.
